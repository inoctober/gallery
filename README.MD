# Simple gallery manager #

This a plugin to organize your gallery. We believe that displaying gallery is theme concern. You can add a gallery set with some medias.

# Usage #

- Install plugin
- Go to Gallery, create some gallery sets and add some medias
- Use gallery components, set gallery sets and paging
- Voila its done

Gallery media's properties
- title (from media name)
- media_url

p.s : We want to add custom title and description feature but we are confused about where to place it so it will can easily used. If you have any ideas don't hesitate to tell us via github issues.

Todos :
- Create tests
- Listen to media delete events (still can't find out how)
